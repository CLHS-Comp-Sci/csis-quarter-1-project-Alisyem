# PasStore
### 2025-26 CLHS Computer Science Independent Study
_Ali Syed_

## Targeted Topic or Skill
_My goal with this project is to increase my proficiency in C#, to learn about implenting randomness into my program, and to learn how to create and write into a text file._

## Description
  _Uses random characters to create a password, stores at most 5 in a text file, and possibly have an option access it and to encrypt it, depending on the time._

## Defense
_I learned a variety of syntax and functions, and utilized them to create my program, PasStore, in C#, which I was not intially familiar with. Over this 9-weeks, I've learned to get user input with Console.ReadLine(), I undestand to a degree on how to get integers from user input using (!int.TryParse(vari), out variabl), I've learned to read and create files using File.AppendAllText(), and I'm now very familar with while loops, and somewhat understanding of for loops._

## Technical
IDE: _VisualStudio Community 2022_
Language: _C#_

## Use
_Just run it in VSCommunity and follow instructions from there. I have not tested Cmd, Powershell, or VSCode._

## Sources
_Search for file in C# - Stack Overflow​
